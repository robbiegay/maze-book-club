<p>The purpose of this site is to display the Mazes I will be building as I read through <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/" target="_blank">Mazes for Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>I have the following learning objectives as I work through "Mazes":</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Build a Mazes web app using .NET Framework, Razor pages, and MVC 5. Complete a <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-net-mvc5-web-apps/table-of-contents">MVC 5 Pluralsight course</a>.
        <ul>
            <li>After week 1, I received feedback that I should port my Mazes web app from .NET Framework to .NET Core. The <a href="https://mazecreator.azurewebsites.net">.NET Framework site</a> is still hosted and you are currently reading this on the new .NET Core site! This learning goal has transitioned to using .NET Core.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Try to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principles</a>. Get feedback from other book club members on how well I am implementing SOLID principles. Learn from code reviewing other book club members' code.</li>
    <li>Work through the "Mazes" book, learning more about algorithms and creating some awesome mazes!</li>
</ul>
